# CODSOFT_03 [ ATM Interface]

This project simulates an ATM machine with basic functionalities such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance check. The project consists of three main classes: `BankAccount`, `ATM`, and `Main`.

## Project Structure

- `BankAccount.java`: Represents the user's bank account and manages the balance.
- `ATM.java`: Represents the ATM machine, provides a user interface for interactions, and connects with the `BankAccount` class to perform transactions.
- `Main.java`: The entry point of the application that initializes the `BankAccount` and `ATM` objects and starts the ATM simulation.
